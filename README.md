##  Lecture Overview

###  What is AI?
- Computers performing tasks that usually require human intelligence.  

###  Key Concepts
- **Machine Learning (ML):** Teaching computers by showing examples instead of coding rules.  
- **Decision Trees:** How AI makes step-by-step decisions.  
- **Deep Learning:** Neural networks inspired by the brain.  
- **Generative AI:** AI that can *create* (text, images, music).  

###  Interactive Elements
- Questions to the audience:  
  - Where do we see AI in daily life?  
  - Is AI more helpful or dangerous?  
  - Could AI be smarter than humans?  
- Hands-on examples of ML & Generative AI.  

###  Applications of AI
- Daily life (recommendations, voice assistants)  
- Creative AI (text, music, art)  
- Future opportunities & challenges
